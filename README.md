This was my school project.<br>
In this project I learned the basics of MVC model in C# WPF, making queries via SqlClient. Even though I learned quite a lot in this project, it was not fully finished.<br>
The only thing that is missing is a server that would accept a message from a client and send it to the other clients on localhost.
